          <p>Welcome to Jason's Guitar Music Theory! Music Theory can enhance your experience when playing, writing, performing and recording music.</p>
          <p>Music theory is the study of music. It includes how music is written, discussed, played and performed.</p>
          <p>This site is designed to explain some basics of music theory from a guitar player's perspective.</p>
          <h4>Reading Guitar Tablature</h4>
          <p>One of the most helpful skills a guitarist can learn is reading guitar tablature. Tablature consists of 6 horizontal lines representing the six strings on the guitar. The lowest line corresponds with the low E string and the highest line is the high E string. The strings from bottom to top are EADGBE. Numbers are placed on the six lines representing what fret to play on each string. When the numbers are stacked on top of each other, it means to play the notes together as in a chord.</p>

          <h4>Key Signatures and the Circle of Fifths</h4>
          <p>Music is generally considered to be in a specific key signature. The key signature is listed at the beginning of a piece of music. This is represented by how many sharps or flats are in the key (think of sharps and flats as the black keys on a piano). The diagram below shows the Circle of Fifths. This is a method of remembering how many sharps and flats are in each key. The relative minor keys are shown in the center of the circle.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>To name the key signature of a sharp key, count from right to left until you arrive at the letter name one step in pitch below the tonic of the key. This gives you the number and order of sharps in the key. (Ex: E major - F#, C#, G#, and D#) </p>
        <p>To name the key signature of a flat key, count from left to right  until you arrive at the letter name of the key, then go one more letter to the right. This gives you the number and order of flats in the key.(Ex: Ab Major - Bb, Eb, Ab, and Db)</p>
